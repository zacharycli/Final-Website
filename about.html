					<p>We are a STEM team from <a href = "crgs.co.uk">Colchester Royal Grammar School</a> made up of six Year 12 students. We are an experienced team, with highlights at the National and International Finals of the <a href = "https://www.firstlegoleague.org/">Lego League</a> competition. This year, we are competing in multiple STEM competitions, including <a href = "https://www.f1inschools.co.uk/">F1 in Schools</a> and <a href = "https://competition.thebigbangfair.co.uk/">The Big Bang Fair</a>. </p>
					<p>All of us study STEM-related subjects, with ambitions to go into Engineering, Architecture, and other STEM fields at University.</p>
					<p> Although we all helped in all areas of the competitions, our specialisms are shown below:</p>
