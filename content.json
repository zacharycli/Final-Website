We will be using a variety of materials, but the common denominator will be the use of a halbach array (a strong magnetic field generator) which we hope will deflect incoming charged particles. This should allow us to deflect particles with lighter shielding than would otherwise be possible",

Several species, such as spirulina, are also edible, and high in a variety of nutrients. Our project revolves around cultivating these beneficial microbes to provide oxygen to astronauts without the issues of raising plants in space. We are also looking into bringing to light the fascinating material of silica aerogel and how it can develop space travel, exploration and survival."

It could, however, also have applications on Earth. Our design centres around photogrammetry: taking photos of the surface of the Earth and building them into a 3D model. To allow us sufficient time for this on our descent, we will be manufacturing a parafoil. We are currently investigating using two-axis control of the parafoil to control our descent. We also plan to carry out the new and revolutionary aerogel particle capture. This uses a material called silica aerogel to obtain particles, which can then be analysed."
