		<p align = "center" size = "20">We have chosen too design our CanSat to carry out early exploration of an expolanet, however it coudld also have applications on earth. Our design centers around photogrammetry: taking photos of the surface of the earth and building them into a 3D model.To allow us sufficent time for this on our descent, we will be manufacturing a parafoil and are currently investigating using 2 axis control of the parafoil too further control our descent. We also plan too carry out the new and revolutionary aerogel particle capture, which uses a special material called silica aergel too obtain particles, which can then later be analysed.</p>
